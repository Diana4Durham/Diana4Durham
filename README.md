## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub! Iâ€™m a DevOps engineer currently diving into ArgoCD and exploring how to implement GitOps workflows in Kubernetes environments. This repository is a reflection of my learning journeyâ€”documenting practical experiments, deployment strategies, and automation patterns as I work toward mastering GitOps for cloud-native infrastructure.

My focus is on understanding how GitOps principlesâ€”like version-controlled infrastructure, automated syncing, and declarative configurationâ€”can improve deployment reliability and simplify operations. With ArgoCD, Iâ€™m learning to manage Kubernetes clusters more efficiently by treating Git repositories as the single source of truth for application state.

Through hands-on projects, Iâ€™m setting up continuous deployment pipelines, practicing application rollbacks, exploring multi-environment deployments, and experimenting with Helm and Kustomize integration. These projects help me better grasp how ArgoCD watches for changes, handles sync operations, and enforces drift detection to ensure consistent cluster state.

This repository includes manifests, configuration templates, workflow examples, and notes from real-world testing scenarios. I aim to structure each project with clarityâ€”making it easier to follow along, reproduce, and adapt to different use cases or environments.

As I continue learning, Iâ€™m also paying close attention to best practices around RBAC, secrets management, app health checks, and securing GitOps pipelines in production-ready settings.

If youâ€™re also exploring ArgoCD, Kubernetes, or GitOps in general, feel free to explore the code, share feedback, or collaborate. Iâ€™m always looking to grow through open-source learning and connect with others passionate about modern DevOps practices.

Thanks for visitingâ€”and hereâ€™s to shipping faster and safer, one pull request at a time.
